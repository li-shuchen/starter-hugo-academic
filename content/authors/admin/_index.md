I am a senior undergraduate in Turing Class, Peking University. My research interests lie in theoretical Computer Science, especially Boolean function analysis, complexity theory, and their connection with mathematics. I'm currently working with [Prof. Xiaoming Sun]() and [Prof. Qian Li](https://theory.ict.ac.cn/en/members/liqian/) on Boolean function analysis.
